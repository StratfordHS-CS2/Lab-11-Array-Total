# Lab 11 - Array Total

## Lab Goal
This lab was designed to give you the opportunity to begin working with arrays.

## Instructions
* Complete the method `total()` so it returns the sum of the values in the array that is passed as a parameter.
  * Run the `main` method in the `ArrayTotalRunner` class to see what your output is.
* Complete all javadoc comment with the proper tags.

## Relevant ThinkJava Section
* [Arrays](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/html/thinkjava6009.html)

## Notes
* The Checkstyle config url is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* Make sure you modify the link at the top of your **Readme.md** to reflect your username if you want the badge at the top to represent the status of your code.

## Grading
* 90 - `total()` works correctly
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
